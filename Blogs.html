        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Why should we stop watching our phones and do something else.&nbsp;(26 June 2025) </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> In todayâ€™s hyper-connected world, our eyes are glued to screens more than ever. From endless scrolling through social media to binge-watching videos that auto play into the night, we often donâ€™t realize just how much of our time is swallowed by our phones. While technology offers remarkable tools and entertainment, thereâ€™s a growing need to pause, look up, and play something elseâ€”something real, refreshing, and human. The constant consumption of screen-based content can dull creativity and reduce our sense of presence. We're fed pre-packaged entertainment, often without interacting, imagining, or contributing ourselves. Our brains crave stimulation, but passive scrolling offers only surface-level satisfaction. In contrast, playâ€”whether it's a physical sport, a board game, or a creative activity like painting or storytellingâ€”activates different parts of the brain, sparks joy, and nourishes our imagination. Playing something off-screen also reconnects us with our environment and the people around us. Remember the thrill of hide-and-seek, the laughter from a quick game of cards with friends, or the joy of building something with your hands? These moments anchor us in the present and bring genuine connectionâ€”something a screen can only simulate. Moreover, physical activity during play supports better health. With so much time spent sitting and staring at phones, many face problems like poor posture, eye strain, and decreased energy levels. Playing outside or engaging in any movement-based activity brings our bodies back into balance. It refreshes us in ways scrolling never could. There's also the matter of attention span. Studies have shown that constantly flipping between apps, messages, and videos can fragment our focus and make it harder to stay engaged with any one thing. Play helps retrain our brains to concentrate, persist, and enjoy things at a deeper pace. Even solo playâ€”like solving puzzles, writing short stories, or inventing new gamesâ€”can be incredibly rewarding. For creators and dreamers, ditching the screen now and then allows new ideas to breathe. You stop absorbing content and start producing it. As someone who's passionate about crafting games and stories, I know firsthand how freeing it is to unplug and let your imagination lead the way. In the end, itâ€™s not about giving up phones entirelyâ€”itâ€™s about balancing screen time with moments of playful engagement. A life filled with more play is a life filled with more laughter, connection, creativity, and vitality. So maybe itâ€™s time we all put our phones down for a while and rediscover the magic that lives beyond the screen.</p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> How I celebrated Rath Yatra ðŸ›•(27 June 2025)</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4">&nbsp;Today is Rath Yatra. It is a famous festival in India, especially on parts of Odisha and West Bengal. I live in Kolkata, India. On this day, three important Hindu Gods (Lord Jaganath, Lord Balaram, Lord Subhadra) ride on Chariots (Rath) in Puri. There is a special fair (Mela) near my home. I am looking forward to this day. I will get my small chariot and decorate it with leaves and flowers, put the respective idols of gods (mentioned earlier) and a a chocolate for each. So if a foreigner is reading my blog, you must come to India and try the sweet prasads (offerings of gods) like Rabdri, Khaja, Jalebi, etc! &nbsp; </p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> Feelings about Mathematics exam on Monday.(28 June 2025)</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6">I have Mathematics Exam on tomorrow. It is my most hated subject ever. But still I have to do it. I am very angry. Anyways, lets I get to the main point. I used to get good marks in every math exam. But I didn't score well in my Class 5 Annual Exam, where I failed (According to my mom, I got 66 out of 80). So I have decided to keep a math tutor. She is strict. I have hoped that I will get good math. I know its my hated subject, but i am improving. It is on Monday. I have Hindi Exam after that. I have done like all of my tutor's homework. It was like many sums. Its 7 pm. I have to finish my blog now. No worries, I am taking extra time. I am feeling 50% happy, 50% Sad and angry. My parents have banned me from watching and playing. I can't even watch and play even after getting good marks. I am really, really frustrated. I have finished chapter one. Just another chapter. Well, I have to go now. Bye!&nbsp; </p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-7"> Excitement after Exam (2 July 2025)</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-8">Sorry Guys, If I was being late. MY EXAMS HAVE JUST ENDED! I am very excited! I dreamt playing games all day not going to school tomorrow. As I said 'dreamt', the opposite is now happening. But guess what? I went to the cinema today with my dad and ate a hotdog! The name of the cinema was 'Sitaare Zameen Par'. For the foreigners who don't understand, the meaning is simply 'Stars on Earth'. So the cinema contains how a coach teaches teens with autism and down syndrome. Alright so, lets talk about some of my hobbies. I like gaming (less, as I can't play), I write stories, draw comics, play PokÃ©mon cards and collect them, play mobile games (secretly) and study a lot. My expectations for my exam results are 18+ pass (except English). I am down for today. (yawns). </p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-9"> Air India 171: What really happened?(7 July 2025)</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-10"> It was one fine afternoon in Ahmedabad, Gujarat in 12th June, 2025. The Airport said that AI-171 had landed and was ready to go to Gatwick. A woman (Mrs. Bhumi Chauhan) was late and could not board the plane. Air refueling was done and Air Crew closed the door of the aircraft. The aircraft was going towards runway. 1.38 minutes later, it was high in the air. Suddenly, the plane was going done. Pilot made Mayday call. ATC asked flight number. No answer. The AI-171 crashed into BJ hostel. One person only survived. (Mr. Vishwash Kumar Ramesh).</p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-11">My Cycle Learning Journey(13 July 2025) </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-12"> When I was just 6 years old, I just started my Cycling Journey. It was the day before my 6th birthday when my one of my father's office colleague gifted me a cycle. I was excited at first. But when I saw the cycle, It was way bigger than me. I became sad because I realized that I was shorter and thinner and couldn't reach the cycle. 5 years later, When my age was 11, It was enough for me to ride my bicycle. The cycle was in the garage for 5 years, so I went to repairing shop to repair it. The cycle was repaired, cleaned, and customized which was making it look like brand new. I went to the safest place where there were very less cars going (I am scared of open roads). I started riding my bicycle with the help of my father as I was new and could fall. Two days later, when I tried to ride my bicycle myself, but I fell and bled myself a lot. After 2 weeks of father's help, I started riding it like magic and was so happy. Then I invited my friend over and we ridded and enjoyed ourselves a lot. End of my journey.</p>
